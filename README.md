<h2 align="center">👾 How to Play 👾</h2>

1. Move the sliders to adjust the wind speed and weather

    💨 **Negative** wind speed makes the wind blow toward the left while positive blows toward the right

    ☀️ Move the weather slider **all the way** toward the left to make it sunny

    💧 Leave the weather slider in the middle to make it rainy, which slightly increases the wind

    ❄️ Move the weather slider **all the way** toward the right to make it snowy, which significantly increases the wind

5. Use the arrow keys to attempt to land the Starship booster on the robotic arm, which is the **lowest** rung on the tower

    ➡️ **Right**: Move booster toward the left

    ⬅️ **Left**: Move booster toward the right

    ⬆️ **Up**: Accelerate upwards to **slow down**

    ⬇️ **Down**: Accelerate downwards to **speed up**
